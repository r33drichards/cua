---

## Quickstart

Install and run a prebuilt macOS VM in two commands:

```bash
# Install Lume
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
# Pull & start a macOS image
lume run macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest
```

<Callout title="Security Note">
  All prebuilt images use the default password `lume`. Change this immediately after your first
  login using the `passwd` command.
</Callout>

**System Requirements**:

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3, etc.)
- macOS 13.0 or later
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
- At least 50GB of free disk space

## Install with Script

Install with a single command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

### Manual Start (No Background Service)

By default, Lume is installed as a background service that starts automatically on login. If you prefer to start the Lume API service manually when needed, you can use the `--no-background-service` option:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh) --no-background-service"
```

<Callout title="Note">
  With this option, you'll need to manually start the Lume API service by running `lume serve` in
  your terminal whenever you need to use tools or libraries that rely on the Lume API (such as the
  Computer-Use Agent).
</Callout>

## Manual Download and Installation

You can also download the `lume.pkg.tar.gz` archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/trycua/cua/releases?q=lume&expanded=true), extract it, and install the package manually.
