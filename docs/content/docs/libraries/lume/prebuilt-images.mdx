title: Prebuilt Images
---

Pre-built images are available in the registry [ghcr.io/trycua](https://github.com/orgs/trycua/packages). These images come with an SSH server pre-configured and auto-login enabled.

<Callout>
  The default password on pre-built images is `lume`. For the security of your VM, change this
  password after your first login.

## Available Images

The following pre-built images are available to download via `lume pull`:

| Image                   | Tag                 | Description                                                                                     | Logical Size |

## Disk Space

For additional disk space, resize the VM disk after pulling the image using the `lume set <name> --disk-size <size>` command. Note that the actual disk space used by sparse images will be much lower than the logical size listed.

<Callout>
  **Important Note (v0.2.0+):** Images are being re-uploaded with sparse file system optimizations
  enabled, resulting in significantly lower actual disk usage. Older images (without the `-sparse`
  suffix) are now **deprecated**. The last version of `lume` fully supporting the non-sparse images
  was `v0.1.x`. Starting from `v0.2.0`, lume will automatically pull images optimized with sparse
  file system support.
