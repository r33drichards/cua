## Claude Desktop Integration

To use with Claude Desktop, add an entry to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`, typically found in `~/.config/claude-desktop/`):

For more information on MCP with Claude Desktop, see the [official MCP User Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

## Cursor Integration

To use with Cursor, add an MCP configuration file in one of these locations:

- **Project-specific**: Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project directory
- **Global**: Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory

After configuration, you can simply tell Cursor's Agent to perform computer tasks by explicitly mentioning the CUA agent, such as "Use the computer control tools to open Safari."

For more information on MCP with Cursor, see the [official Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).
