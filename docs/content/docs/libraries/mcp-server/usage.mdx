## Usage

Once configured, you can simply ask Claude to perform computer tasks:

- "Open Chrome and go to github.com"
- "Create a folder called 'Projects' on my desktop"
- "Find all PDFs in my Downloads folder"
- "Take a screenshot and highlight the error message"

Claude will automatically use your CUA agent to perform these tasks.

### First-time Usage Notes

**API Keys**: Ensure you have valid API keys:

- Add your Anthropic API key, or other model provider API key in the Claude Desktop config (as shown above)
- Or set it as an environment variable in your shell profile
