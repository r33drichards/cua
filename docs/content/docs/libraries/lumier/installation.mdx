title: Installation
---

Before using Lumier, make sure you have:

1. **Docker for Apple Silicon** - download it [here](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Lume** - This is the virtualization CLI that powers Lumier. Install it with this command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

After installation, Lume runs as a background service and listens on port 7777. This service allows Lumier to create and manage virtual machines. If port 7777 is already in use on your system, you can specify a different port with the `--port` option when running the `install.sh` script.
