**Lumier** is an interface for running macOS virtual machines with minimal setup. It uses Docker as a packaging system to deliver a pre-configured environment that connects to the `lume` virtualization service running on your host machine. With Lumier, you get:

- A ready-to-use macOS or Linux virtual machine in minutes
- Browser-based VNC access to your VM
- Easy file sharing between your host and VM
- Simple configuration through environment variables

## How It Works

<Callout title="Note">
  We're using Docker primarily as a convenient delivery mechanism, not as an isolation layer. Unlike
  traditional Docker containers, Lumier leverages the Apple Virtualization Framework (Apple Vz)
  through the `lume` CLI to create true virtual machines.
</Callout>

Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

1. The Docker container provides a consistent environment to run the Lumier interface
2. Lumier connects to the Lume service running on your host Mac
3. Lume uses Apple's Virtualization Framework to create a true macOS virtual machine
4. The VM runs with hardware acceleration using your Mac's native virtualization capabilities
